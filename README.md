<h3>JAVA version: 13</h3>
<h3> Assumptions and implementations :</h3> 

We have used Item class. Classes Music , Players , Instruments, Clothing,Accessories
inherit Item class. Classes PaperScore, CD, Vinyl inherit Music , Classes CD Players,
RecordPlayer, MP3 inherit Players. Classes Stringed and Wind inherit Instruments.Similarly,
other classes are created and inherited according to the UML diagram. We have used multi-level inheritance.
We have defined a Clerk class which inherits the Staff class. The clerk performs the following functions- 
checkRegister, goToBank, doInventory,placeOrder,openStore,cleanStore, leaveTheStore. The customer class
implements buy and sell methods as per the requirements and in the UML diagram. 
<br>The Simulator class runs for 30 days
doing the following in order- checkRegister , doInventory, openStore and then print the itemsLeft, the items sold and the price, 
the final count of money in the cashRegister and the money added to register from goToBank action. <br><br>
<b>Note :We could not fit the sub-classes of Music class in the UML because we are using Lucid Chart for creating
the UML and we had exhausted the edits. </b>
